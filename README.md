# Free Image Resources

As I started developing open source projects I realized that it is hard to find image resources, 
which are really completely free to use. Even if declared so, there is somewhat license which causes
limitations. Even simple loader gifs where hard to find.

So I decided to create this repo, where I share images I create myself, like few others have done. The only license aspect is that
I don't offer warranty of any kind (`The Unlicense`)

As time passes, I will keep on adding images one by one.

## Animated gifs

I started with animated gifs. I upload the GIF as well as SVG- and XCF-Files. Using GIMP you can easily set the speed of the animation or the size.
